# Overview
CloudTest is a cloud-based testing application for load and performance testing of mobile and web applications to ensure these won't fail under peak user traffic. It can be hosted on one or more physical servers over the customer premises or in the cloud. For the cloud option, it uses cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services to simulate traffic.

It records network traffic from the browser or any application that sends requests through HTTP protocol and then replays the saved transactions from the backend mimicking the behavior of the user.

You can launch instances through cloud-providers and simulate from hundreds to thousands of requests to load test your application from different world locations and once the test has ended, tear down these temporary instances. This makes is a cost-effective solution for load and performance testing.
