# Monitoring
The "Monitoring" page allows configure and create monitors for keeping track of the resource compumption of the server instances added. It's also possible to test targets by doing SSH and executing remote commands (similar to SiteScope, New Relic or equivalent monitoring solutions).

First create a "Monitor Server Group" with the resources to monitor. The LG and Main could be grouped together within the same monitor group as both use the same user and password. After this, go to "Monitors" and select the items to monitor.

Once the monitors are setup, the server monitoring can be enabled at the "Composition" y going to Properties -> Monitoring tab.

There are Dashboards for monitoring that correlate or combine the data of virtual users against the monitoring metrics.

It's also possible to gather monitoring data from the "Conductor".
